# OpenRVDAS Django GUI (DRAFT)

## Overview

Please see the [README.md file in the parent directory](../README.md)
for an introduction to the OpenRVDAS system. This document discusses
specifically a Django-based GUI for interacting with the system.

Django (<https://www.djangoproject.com/>) is a high-level web
framework written in/for Python. It is not intended to be *the* GUI
framework for OpenRVDAS, just one framework with which OpenRVDAS
works.

The current code in this directory represents a very preliminary GUI
that will likely change substantially both in look-and-feel and
underlying implementation. It is presented here a proof of concept
from which to identify shortcomings in performance, functionality and
ease of use.

## Installation

If you have already installed the files needed to run the core
OpenRVDAS code, as described in [the parent directory
INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md), there are only a couple more steps needed
to run the GUI:

1. Install Django and websockets (future implementations may use
Django's "channels" functionality rather than websockets):
```
  pip3 install websockets
  pip3 install Django==2.0
```

## Running

This section describes running the GUI using the simplified Django
test server and the default SQLite database. Actual deployments will
likely require more robust services, such as Apache and MySQL or
MariaDB.

0. Create a settings.py file from the template:
```
cp ./django_gui/settings.py.dist ./django_gui/settings.py
```

1. Set up the default Django database models (uses SQLite, as
configured in django_gui/settings.py):
```
  python3 manage.py makemigrations django_gui
  python3 manage.py migrate
  python3 manage.py createsuperuser --email rvdas@somerandom.com --username rvdas
```
2. Start the LoggerManager as a server (as per in [the server README.md](../server/README.md)),
specifying the Django backing store:
```
  server/logger_manager.py --websocket localhost:8765 --database django
```
Note that Javascript on the Django pages will try to connect to the
LoggerManager at port 8765 by default. You can change this in
django_gui/settings.py if you need to use another port). To open this port
for websockets on CentOS, run:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8765/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
Once the LoggerManager is running, you can control it from the command line
as described in [the server README.md](../server/README.md), and you can type
"help" for a complete list of commands.

3. To control the LoggerManager via Django, start the Django test server:
```
  python3 ./manage.py runserver localhost:8000
```
4. In a browser window, visit ```http://localhost:8000```

5. The sample cruise configuration relies on simulated serial ports
serving data stored in the test/ directory. To set up the simulated
ports, run
```
  python3 logger/utils/simulate_serial.py --config test/serial_sim.json 
```

At this point in the browser window, you should see an indication that
no configuration is loaded, along with a prompt to log in. Log in
using the rvdas account you created.

Select "Load configuration file" to select and load the file
```test/configs/sample_cruise.json```. This file is a complete cruise
specification configuration created by the logger/utils/build_config.py
script as follows:
```
  python3 logger/utils/build_config.py --config test/configs/sample_cruise.json > cruise.json
```

The GUI window should now update to show a set of loggers,
configurations and mode selector in mode "off". Select the mode
"underway" (it will turn yellow), then hit "Change mode" to
commit. The LoggerServer will select the logger configurations
appropriate for the selected mode and run them.

You can manually select configurations on a logger-by-logger basis by
selecting the configuration button for that logger and using the
resulting pull-down menu. If a logger is not in the default
configuration for the current mode, its configuration button will be
yellow.

The sample configurations use UDP broadcasts to port 6224 for network
writes and subdirectories under /tmp/log/NBP1700/ for file writes. You
can run a listener on the port using
```
  python3 logger/listener/listen.py --network :6224 --write_file -
```
to listen to the appropriate port, or
```
  tail -f /tmp/log/NBP1700/*/*/*
```
to watch logfiles being written.

Note also that you can still observe the state of the system if you
are not logged in (e.g. as ```rvdas```), but you will be unable to
select or change any configurations.

The "server log" link will open a new page showing the diagnostic messages
from the LoggerManager. This page could use some improvement, but for now
the path encodes the minimum log level to be displayed (10 = DEBUG, 20 = INFO,
30 = WARNING) and optionally which message source to display (empty means all):
```
   localhost:8000/server_messages/<log_level>/<source>
```
E.g., you could display only logger debug information by opening the URL
```
   localhost:8000/server_messages/10/Logger
```

### Widgets

A very rudimentary display widget has been implemented in
```
http://localhost:8000/widget
```
It draws its data from records written to the database, so will only
display new data when the relevant loggers are writing to the database
(in the sample configuration, this happens in underway mode, or if you
manually select a net/file/db configuration for an individual logger).

To use it, append the widget path name with a comma-separated list of
Fields you wish to monitor, e.g.
```
http://localhost:8000/widget/S330Roll,S330Pitch
```
The S330Roll and S330Pitch fields are produced by the s330 logger,
so select and enable the s330 -> net/file/db configuration. If
all has gone well, the widget values should begin to update.

## Next Steps

1. Allow servers to be started/stopped from the web UI. This would
probably entail making run_servers.py an always-running service and
have the management page control it by storing desired server states
in the Django ServerStates table.

2. The current UI is...rudimentary. It would be nice to have someone
who understands both UI and web design to have a go at a V2.
