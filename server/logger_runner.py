"""Low-level class to start/stop loggers according passed in
definitions and commands.

Intended to be used in one of four ways:

(See note below about simulated serial ports if you want to try the
command lines below)

1. As a simple standalone logger runner: you give it an intial dict of
   logger configurations, and it tries to keep them running.

     server/logger_runner.py --config test/configs/sample_configs.json

   Note: the LoggerRunner doesn't know anything about modes, and doesn't
   take a full cruise definition - it just takes a dict of logger
   configurations and runs them.

2. As instantiated by a LoggerManager:

     server/logger_manager.py --config test/configs/sample_cruise.json -v

   When invoked as above, the LoggerManager will instantiate a LoggerRunner
   interpret commands from the command line and dispatch the requested
   loggers to its LoggerRunner. (Type "help" on the LoggerManager command
   line for the commands it understands.)

3. As instantiated by some other script that directly creates and
   manages a LoggerRunner object.

4. As a websocket client taking orders from a LoggerManager:

     server/run_loggers.py --websocket localhost:8765 --host_id knud.host

   with a LoggerManager running like this:

     server/logger_manager.py --websocket :8765 --host_id master.host

   When invoked with the --websocket flag, a LoggerManager will
   attempt to create a websocket server at the specified address and
   listen for clients to connect.

   When invoked with the --websocket and --host_id flags, a
   LoggerRunner will attempt to connect to the named address and
   identify itself by the provided host_id.

   When the LoggerManager identifies a config to be run that includes
   a host_id restriction, e.g.

        "knud->net": {
            "host_id": "knud.host",
            "readers": ...
            ...
         }

   it will attempt to dispatch that config to the appropriate
   client. (Note: configs with no host restriction will be run by the
   LoggerManager itself, and if a config has a host restriction and no
   host by that name has connected, the LoggerManager will issue a
   warning and not run the config.)


Simulated Serial Ports:

The sample_cruise.json and sample_configs.json files above specify
configs that read from simulated serial ports and write to UDP port
6224. To get the configs to actually run, you'll need to run

  logger/utils/serial_sim.py --config test/serial_sim.py

in a separate terminal window to create the virtual serial ports the
sample config references and feed simulated data through them.)

To verify that the scripts are actually working as intended, you can
create a network listener on port 6224 in yet another window:

  logger/listener/listen.py --network :6224 --write_file -
