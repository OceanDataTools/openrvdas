# OpenRVDAS

## Overview

The Open Research Vessel Data Acquisition System (OpenRVDAS) is a
software framework used for building custom data acquisition systems
(DAS).  OpenRVDAS target audiences are oceanographic research vessel
operators and operators of other science-related platforms that have
the need to record streaming data.  OpenRVDAS is capable of reading
data records from serial ports and network-aware sensors, optionally
modifying those data records and streaming either the result to one or
more destinations, including logfiles, network ports, databases, etc.

OpenRVDAS is designed to be modular and extensible, relying on simple
composition of Readers, Transforms and Writers to achieve the needed
datalogging functionality.

## Motivation

The primary purpose of an oceanographic research vessel is to gather
data from sensors. Oceanographic research vessels carry a combination
of oceanographic, meteorological and other specialized sensors. Some
of the more complex sensors (i.e. ADCP, Multibeam, imaging systems)
include specialized data acquisition systems tailored to the
particlular sensor. Many simpler sensors, however, can simply stream
data values over a network port or serial connection.

At present there are limited options for operators wishing to store
and display data from these simple sensors. This task is commonly
referred to as underway data logging.  Most research vessel operators
rely on closed-source, solutions (i.e. SCS, WinFrog) or on dated
datalogging systems (i.e.  dsLog, LDS) for underway data logging.
Both options provide limited support mechanisms, thus bugs are slow to
be resolved and feature requests are slow to be implemented.

OpenRVDAS hopes to provide an alternative underway data logging 
solution that is defined, developed and maintained by the global
oceanographic research community.

OpenRVDAS recognizes that each ship is different, that each ship has a
unique set of sensors and that each ship has a unique way of
operating.  With this understanding, OpenRVDAS does not try provide a
turn-key, one- size-fits-all solution but instead provides research
vessel operators with a modular and extensible toolset for developing
and deploying a custom underway datalogging solution tailored to the
vessel's individual needs.

DISCLAIMER: THIS CODE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND STILL IN THE *VERY* EARLY
STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IT SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE RELIED ON,
ESPECIALLY NOT IN ANY APPLICATION WHERE ITS FAILURE COULD RESULT IN
INJURY, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY, SANITY OR CREDIBILITY AMONG YOUR PEERS
WHO WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for details on how to install OpenRVDAS

## Data logging

### Writing a custom logging script
Individual logging modules can be composed using a few lines of
Python, e.g.

```
    reader = SerialReader(port='/dev/ttyr15', baudrate=9600)
    timestamp_transform = TimestampTransform()
    prefix_transform = PrefixTransform(prefix=‘knud’)
    logfilewriter = LogfileWriter(filebase=‘/data/logs/current/knud’)
    while True:
      in_record = reader.read()
      ts_record = timestamp_transform.transform(in_record)
      out_record = prefix_transform.transform(ts_record)
      writer.write_record(out_record)
```

#### Full API Reference
Documentation (also still incomplete) for the code is available online
in a shared Google Doc folder via the shortcut url
<http://tinyurl.com/openrvdas-docs>.

### Logging with listen.py
The listen.py script is included to provide access to the most
commonly used Readers, Transforms and Writers from the command line,
e.g.
```
  listen.py --serial port=/dev/ttyr15,baudrate=9600 \
      --timestamp --prefix knud \
      --write_logfile /data/logs/current/knud
```
#### More information on listen.py
For full details on the use of listen.py, run:
```
  logger/listener/listen.py --help
```

### Running logger_runner.py and logger_manager.py
Server scripts for managing multiple loggers are described in the [server/README.md file](servers/README.md).

### Running the Django-based web interface
Installation and running of the Django-based web interface is described in the [django_gui/README.md file](django_gui/README.md).
