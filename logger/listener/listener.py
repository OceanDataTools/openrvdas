class Listener:
  """Listener is a simple, yet relatively self-contained class that
  takes a list of one or more Readers, a list of zero or more
  Transforms, and a list of zero or more Writers. It calls the Readers
  (in parallel) to acquire records, passes those records through the
  Transforms (in series), and sends the resulting records to the Writers
  (in parallel).

    readers        A single Reader or a list of Readers.

    transforms     A single Transform or a list of zero or more Transforms

    writers        A single Writer or a list of zero or more Writers

    host_id        Optional host_id on which Listener is to be run. Ignored
                   here, but it may show up as part of a config, so we need
                   to be able to handle is in kwargs.

    interval       How long to sleep before reading sequential records

    name           Optional human-readable short name to be used in displays

    check_format   If True, attempt to check that Reader/Transform/Writer
                   formats are compatible, and throw a ValueError if they
                   are not. If check_format is False (the default) the
                   output_format() of the whole reader will be
