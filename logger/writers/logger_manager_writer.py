"""
Writer that sends records it receives to the LoggerManager as commands. Can
be used in conjunction with GeofenceTransform for automatically switching
modes when entering/exiting an EEZ, or with a QCFilterTransform to turn off
loggers when conditions are violated.

Multiple commands may be sent in a single record by separating them with
semicolons.

In addition to the normally-accepted LoggerManager commands, an additional
one: "sleep N" is recognized, which will pause the writer N seconds before
writing the subsequent command. This allows time, if needed, for the effects
of prior commands to settle.

Sample logger that switches modes when entering/exiting EEZ:
```
# Read the latest lat/lon from the Cached Data Server
readers:
  class: CachedDataReader
  kwargs:
    data_server: localhost:8766
    subscription:
      fields:
        s330Latitude:
          seconds: 0
        s330Longitude:
          seconds: 0
# Look for lat/lon values in the DASRecords and emit appropriate commands
# when entering/leaving EEZ. Note that EEZ files in GML format can be
# downloaded from https://marineregions.org/eezsearch.php.
transforms:
  - class: GeofenceTransform
    module: logger.transforms.geofence_transform
    kwargs:
      latitude_field_name: s330Latitude,
      longitude_field_name: s330Longitude
      boundary_file_name: /tmp/eez.gml
      leaving_boundary_message: set_active_mode write+influx
      entering_boundary_message: set_active_mode no_write+influx
# Send the messages that we get from geofence to the LoggerManager
writers:
  - class: LoggerManagerWriter
    module: logger.writers.logger_manager_writer
    kwargs:
      database: django
      allowed_prefixes:
        - 'set_active_mode '
        - 'sleep '
