"""Read lat/lon from passed records and compare to a geofence loaded at initialization
time. Emit pre-defined messages if lat/lon transition between inside and outside of
fence.

EEZ files in GML format can be downloaded from https://marineregions.org/eezsearch.php

Sample logger that switches modes when entering/exiting EEZ:
```
# Read parsed DASRecords from UDP
readers:
  class: UDPReader
  kwargs:
    port: 6224
# Look for lat/lon values in the DASRecords and emit appropriate commands
# when entering/leaving EEZ. Note that EEZ files in GML format can be
# downloaded from https://marineregions.org/eezsearch.php.
transforms:
  - class: GeofenceTransform
    module: logger.transforms.geofence_transform
    kwargs:
      latitude_field_name: s330Latitude,
      longitude_field_name: s330Longitude
      boundary_file_name: /tmp/eez.gml
      leaving_boundary_message: set_active_mode write+influx
      entering_boundary_message: set_active_mode no_write+influx
# Send the messages that we get from geofence to the LoggerManager
writers:
  - class: LoggerManagerWriter
    module: logger.writers.logger_manager_writer
    kwargs:
      database: django
      allowed_prefixes:
        - 'set_active_mode '
        - 'sleep '
```
Some questions:
- Should messages be emitted when first record is received? That is, when transform
  first fires up, should it send the "entering_boundary_message" if the first record
  it receives indicates it's inside? DECISION: Yes.

NOTE: optional parameter distance_from_boundary is in degrees. Computing the appropriate
value in km/nm is nontrivial and requires figuring out the right UTM projection for each
location and recomputing it for each point and switching when lat/lon moved to a new UTM
projection area, possibly resulting in discontinuities. Simpler and less error-prone
to just require degrees.
