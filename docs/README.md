The Open Research Vessel Data Acquisition System (OpenRVDAS) is a software framework used for building custom data acquisition systems (DAS). OpenRVDAS target audiences are oceanographic research vessel operators and operators of other science-related platforms that have the need to record streaming data. OpenRVDAS is capable of reading data records from serial ports and network-aware sensors, optionally modifying those data records and streaming either the result to one or more destinations, including logfiles, network ports, databases, etc.

OpenRVDAS is designed to be modular and extensible, relying on simple composition of Readers, Transforms and Writers to achieve the needed datalogging functionality.

The project code repository is at [https://github.com/davidpablocohn/openrvdas](https://github.com/davidpablocohn/openrvdas).

Please see the [OpenRVDAS Introduction and Overview](intro_and_overview.md), the [Introduction to Loggers](intro_to_loggers.md) and [Controlling Loggers](controlling_loggers.md) to get started.
